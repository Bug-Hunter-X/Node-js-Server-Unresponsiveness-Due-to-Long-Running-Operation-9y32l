# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a long-running operation in the request handler can cause the server to become unresponsive to new requests.  The example uses a simple `while` loop to simulate a long task, but this could be any blocking operation.

The solution showcases how to address this using asynchronous programming techniques such as promises or async/await, allowing the server to remain responsive even during lengthy operations.
